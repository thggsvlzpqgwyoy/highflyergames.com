          <p>We may share information we have collected about you in certain situations. Your information may be
            disclosed as follows:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>By Law or to Protect Rights:</strong> If we believe the release of information about you is
              necessary to respond to legal process, to investigate or remedy potential violations of our policies, or
              to protect the rights, property, and safety of others, we may share your information as permitted or
              required by any applicable law, rule, or regulation.</li>
            <li><strong>Third-Party Service Providers:</strong> We may share your information with third parties that
              perform services for us or on our behalf, including data analysis, email delivery, hosting services,
              customer service, and marketing assistance.</li>
            <li><strong>Marketing Communications:</strong> With your consent, or with an opportunity for you to withdraw
              consent, we may share your information with third parties for marketing purposes, as permitted by law.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Interactions with Other Users:</strong> If you interact with other users of the Site, those
              users may see your name, profile photo, and descriptions of your activity, including sending invitations
              to other users, chatting with other users, blogging, and playing games.</li>
            <li><strong>Affiliates:</strong> We may share your information with our affiliates, in which case we will
              require those affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy. Affiliates include our parent company and any
              subsidiaries, joint venture partners, or other companies that we control or that are under common control
              with us.</li>
            <li><strong>Business Partners:</strong> We may share your information with our business partners to offer
              you certain products, services, or promotions.</li>
            <li><strong>Other Third Parties:</strong> We may share your information with advertisers and investors for
              the purpose of conducting general business analysis. We may also share your information with such third
              parties for marketing purposes, as permitted by law.</li>
            <li><strong>Sale or Bankruptcy:</strong> If we reorganize or sell all or a portion of our assets, undergo a
              merger, or are acquired by another entity, we may transfer your information to the successor entity. If we
              go out of business or enter bankruptcy, your information would be an asset transferred or acquired by a
              third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur and that the transferee may decline to honor
              the commitments we made in this Privacy Policy.</li>
          </ul>
          <h2><strong>4. Security of Your Information</strong></h2>
          <p>We use administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your personal information.
            While we have taken reasonable steps to secure the personal information you provide to us, please be aware
            that despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and no method of data
            transmission can be guaranteed against any interception or other type of misuse. Any information disclosed
            online is vulnerable to interception and misuse by unauthorized parties. Therefore, we cannot guarantee
            complete security if you provide personal information. This includes safeguarding your highflyer casino
            login details and transaction data for highflyer casino Ontario.</p>
          <h2><strong>5. Policy for Children</strong></h2>
          <p>We do not knowingly solicit information from or market to children under the age of 18. If you become aware
            of any data we have collected from children under age 18, please contact us using the contact information
            provided below.</p>
          <h2><strong>6. Controls for Do-Not-Track Features</strong></h2>
          <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT")
            feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online
            browsing activities monitored and collected. No uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing
            DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other
            mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online
            tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised
            version of this Privacy Policy.</p>
          <h2><strong>7. Your Privacy Rights</strong></h2>
          <p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights regarding your personal information, such as the right
            to access, correct, delete, or port your data. To exercise these rights, please contact us using the contact
            information below.</p>
          <h2><strong>8. Updates to this Policy</strong></h2>
          <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to our
            practices or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons. Please therefore re-visit this Privacy
            Policy regularly to stay informed about our collection, use, and disclosure of your information.</p>
          <p>The date at the top of this Privacy Policy indicates when it was last updated.</p>
          <h2><strong>9. Contact Us</strong></h2>
